"""
A `service` (:py:mod:`miniworld.service`) in miniworld provides functionality to achieve something (such as starting an emulation or the nodes).
In contrast to a `model` (:py:mod:`miniworld.model`), it may use other services and does not model an entity such as an a node or a link.
A service uses models to store data.
